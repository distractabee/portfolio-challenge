# My Developer Portfolio

## Description

I wanted to create a simple introductory webpage for myself in my new career path as a developer, as well as a home for my projects, so I built this portfolio webpage. In this project I used all the CSS and HTML that I have studied so far to create a visually appealing and accesible webpage with my work so far as well as my contact information.


## Credits

I repurposed code from my prior projects, some of which was created by the bootcamp I'm taking, and my instructor in the boot camp, Jon Lynch.

Additionally, my profile picture was created using [Ummmmandy's picrew](https://picrew.me/ja/image_maker/114808/)
